    <h1> Video and Syllabus Essay</h1>
    <p> In the video, Makuyo had plenty of things to say that were reflected in the syllabus.</p>
    <br>For example:
    <br>
 <ul>
   <li>Peer Grading</li>
   <li>Essential Collaboration</li>
   <li>Soft Skills</li>
</ul>
   <br> 
   <p> I believe that both the video and the syllabus shared extremely useful information that is essential for the rest of our lives. 
   In reality, we always ask for someone elses approval in order to improve something. So what is the difference when it's a school 
   project/work project? It is that you may or may not know the person that's reviewing your work and it builds better communication skills.
   The last similarity is Soft Skills. The soft skills in the syllabus wasn't explicitly said but implied if you paid close attention. 
   In the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uOA-kzolTFWs9eUftw3o8SZX7LM_w8cy9kj9h3g6pZE/edit"> syllabus </a>, on page 4, 
   it says <q>  ...as well as make you a better communicator.</q> This reflects a type of education that can't be taught on paper, but 
   only through empirical investigation. </p>
   
    
   <p> Here is a list of things that weren't in the syllabus but important in the video: </p>
   <br>
  <ul>
   <li>Empathy</li>
   <li>Not Buying Into Stereotypes</li>
</ul>
